# Zillow_Scraper
This is my first programming project ever! I recently just completed a Python course on Udemy(S/O Jose) and I wanted to build my own project from stratch. I wanted this project to me meaningful and impactful to me, and since I am currently considering moving from my current apartment, I wanted to know what other apartments/homes are renting for in the city I am currently in. I decided to build a webscraper grabs all the listing info on Zillows website and writes it out to a CSV file using Pandas.

## Features 
The code is currently hard coded to Arlington Tx, but it can be easily formmated to the city and state you live by changing the link in the code.
* Grabs all the listing info in specified city 
* Writes the name,details(price,bedroom), address to a CSV file

## Install
Use the following pip command:
* pip install selenium
* pip install pandas
